# what-i-learn-week-6
## 1 - I learned array. Array can contain multiple type of datas like string, number, boolean, function, and even array.
~~ const array = [1, 'a', true, [], function()]
Array has similar properties as string and more: **arr.length, arr[1][2], arr.push(), arr.unshift(), arr.splice(), arr.slice(), etc**
## 2 - I learn ***while loop*** and ***for loop***
### While Loop has longer syntax, yet, it's more versatile when I need to code a complicated loop
~~ while (condition) {
some thing happens
}
### For loop has minimums syntax, and is used when I loop through indince in an array, object or string
~~ for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
some thing happens}
